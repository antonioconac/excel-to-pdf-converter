# Invoice Generator
• This project is a simple yet effective Invoice Generator that takes data from an Excel spreadsheet and transforms it into a clean, formatted PDF invoice. The input is a basic Excel table that contains information such as product ID, product name, quantity purchased, price per unit, and total price per item. The program reads this data, performs any necessary calculations (like total cost), and then automatically generates a professional-looking invoice in PDF format.

• The purpose of this tool is to simplify and automate the invoice creation process, especially for small businesses or personal projects where manually formatting invoices can be time-consuming. It captures all essential purchase details in a structured table, and it also includes a summary of the total price at the bottom for clarity.

• The input table in excel looks like:<br>
